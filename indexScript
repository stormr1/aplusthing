Instructions

Pull up the bookmark bar with ctrl+shift+B, it may a bit be subtle, but there should be a white bar right under the url bar. Right click the bookmark bar, click "Add page..."
You should now see a dialogue reading "edit bookmark." Any name works, but most importantly, copy the code at the bottom of the page into the url field, then click "Save"
Now, normally opening up APlus would open a pop-up window, but we want this to open in the main browser. Paste this into the url bar instead http://www.wba.aplusanywhere.com/als/?customer=ombudsmainoffice&plan=C
From there you should open the bookmark everytime you begin a new test or whatever theyre called. 
The "`" key gives the answer, its in the top left corner, right under the Esc key. If it gets it wrong, try pressing keys between 0-3, this will switch between what are essentially "modes." Modes will persist until the test is exited
Different classes prefer different modes, and though I've found them to mostly consist of 0 or 3, there are a few outliers and even some classes in which this exploit wont work at all. Its all up to some really simple experimentation, really

Optional

If you want to set a default mode, you can change the mode by editing the "indexMode" variable at the start of the code to your own mode. Find "indexMode=0" and change the 0 to whatever mode youd like
